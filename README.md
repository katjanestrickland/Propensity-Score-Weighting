# Achieving Balance through Weighting
## The Influence of Survey Weighting Methods on Propensity Score Matching

Weighting schemes in propensity score matching are intimately tied to the survey literature, both in their technical foundations, and the limitations that accompany them. In this analysis, I identify the effect of the special-education inclusion model on attendance rates in NYC public schools, by matching the population of third grade classrooms in the 2017-2018 school year on five covariates. Overlap weight result in lowest standard error of the ATE, closely followed by IPTW.
