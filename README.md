## The influence of Survey Weighting Methods on Propensity Score Matching

Review of the influence of survey weighting methodology on propensity score methods, where weights are put on sampling units to help make the sample as representative of the population as possible. This paper reviews how weighting schemes in propensity score matching are intimately tied to the survey literature, both in their technical foundations, and the limitations that accompany them.
