# Achieving Balance through Weighting
## The Influence of Survey Weighting Methods on Propensity Score Matching

Weighting schemes in propensity score matching are intimately tied to the survey literature, both in their technical foundations and limitations. In this analysis, I identify the effect of the special-education inclusion model on attendance rates in NYC public schools, by matching the population of third grade classrooms in the 2017-2018 school year on a set of five covariates. Overlap weighting (Li, Thomas & Li 2019) results in the lowest standard error of the Average Treatment Effect, closely followed by Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting.
